# OriginStack

OriginStack is a lightweight, repeatable system to build **trust & buyer access** for African exports (starting with coffee).  
It powers a network of country microsites and a global hub:

- 🌍 VerifyCoffee.com — global verification & badges
- 🇰🇪 KenyaOrigin.com — Kenya exporters
- 🇪🇹 EthiopiaOrigin.com — Ethiopia exporters
- 🇺🇬 UgandaOrigin.com — Uganda exporters
- 🇷🇼 RwandaOrigin.com — Rwanda exporters

---

## Why it exists
Exporters need credibility. Buyers need trust.  
OriginStack delivers **Verification Badges**, **public verify pages** (`/verify/{slug}`), and **curated introductions**.
