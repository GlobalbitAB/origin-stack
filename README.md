# OriginStack

OriginStack is a lightweight infrastructure for building **trust and verification layers** around African export sectors (starting with coffee).  
This repo powers three sites:

- 🌍 [VerifyCoffee.com](#verifycoffee) — global coffee badge & verification
- 🇰🇪 [KenyaOrigin.com](#kenyaorigin) — verified Kenyan exports
- 🇪🇹 [EthiopiaOrigin.com](#ethiopiaorigin) — verified Ethiopian exports

---

## 🚀 Purpose

African exporters need **credibility** and global buyers need **trust**.  
OriginStack connects the two with:

- ✅ **Verification Badges** (document-checked exporters)
- 📄 **Public Verify Pages** (`/verify/{slug}`)
- 📊 **Origin Reports** (trends, price insights, spotlighted suppliers)
- ⚡ **Automation Flows** (intake → Sheets, waitlist → MailerLite, QR badge generation)
